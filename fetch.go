  Download binaries from a remote, retrieving only the binaries referenced
  by recent commits visible in the git repo. The definition of 'recent' depends
  on whether you specify a list of references to fetch or not, and some
  configuration parameters. See RECENT COMMITS below.

Parameters:
  <remote>: The remote to download from. This should correspond to the 
            name of a remote (no direct URLs permitted) which is configured
            in .git/config. See REMOTES below for more details, additional
            config parameters are required in the remote.

            If no remote is specified, and --all is not specified, the remote
            that your current branch is tracking will be used, or origin if 
            tracking is not configured.
     <ref>: Which reference(s) we should make sure binaries downloaded for. 
            You can specify zero, one, or many refs, but these refs must be
            present locally (ie already fetched with plain git). git-lob
            does not perform the 'git fetch' for you and can only look at
            commits already present in your repo.

            If no ref is specified, git-lob will look at 'recent' commits.
            See RECENT COMMITS below.

            COMMIT RANGES

            You can also specify a range of refs in the form <ref1>..<ref2> to
            tell git-lob to make sure you have all binaries referenced by all
            commits in a given range, whether 'recent' or not.


Options:
  --all         Download from all configured remotes.
  --force       Always download files even if the provider believes the file is 
                already present locally. 
  --prune       As well as downloading files referenced by 'recent' commits, 
                delete any local files you already have which now fall outside
                this definition of 'recent'. See RECENT COMMITS below.
  --quiet, -q   Print less output
  --verbose, -v Print more output
  --dry-run     Don't actually delete anything, just report

REMOTES

Binaries in git-lob are not stored in the regular git repo, but a corresponding
binary store must always exist to provide the actual binary content. A remote
in git usually only gives you the real git repo, so git-lob needs to expand
the configuration parameters to git remotes to specify the location of the 
corresponding remote binary store. 

The <remote> parameter refers to a named remote in .git/config (plain URLs 
cannot be supported). The remote entry itself is the same as any normal git
remote, except that it requires additional git-lob specific parameters. The
parameters depend on the type of binary storage ('provider') being used; see
'git-lob providers' for a list of available providers and 
'git-lob provider <provider>' for specific details of one provider.

As an example, let's take the 'filesystem' provider, which simply uses the OS's
file system as a remote transport (obviously very simplistic):

[remote "origin"]
    # these 2 lines are standard git
    url = ssh://git@bitbucket.org/something/somthing.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    # these next 2 lines are required to configure the remote binary store
    git-lob-provider = filesystem
    git-lob-path = /Volumes/shared/something/something/binary/store
    
Other providers may require other parameters. It's important to note that you
can share a binary store among multiple remote repos if you wish, much like
the local git-lob.sharedstore option, since binaries are stored by SHA. 
Identical file content in multiple repos can be stored only once this way.
Of course, access control may be an issue to consider here though.
