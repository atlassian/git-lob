Dependencies are managed with godep. If you wish to add a dependency, add it
in the usual GOPATH and import it from there, then once you're happy with 
the state, run 'godep save -r' to take a snapshot. Note that this rewrites the 
imports to refer to the local _workspace copy to  simplify using the 
dependency from then on.
