Setting up Go environment
-------------------------

1. Install Go tools from https://golang.org/doc/install
   If you need to cross-compile to other platforms, install from source. 
   Otherwise the binary install is fine
2. If you don't have a GOPATH already:
   a. Create a folder somewhere in your user area, e.g. ~/Go
   b. Create subfolders 'src', 'bin' and 'pkg'
   c. Create an environment variable GOPATH pointing at the root dir e.g. ~/Go
      On Windows, open Control Panel > System > Advanced > Environment variables
      On Mac/Linux, edit ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile and export GOPATH=blah
   d. If you wish, add $GOPATH/bin to your PATH the same way
3. If you want to cross-compile, install Gox (https://github.com/mitchellh/gox)
    go get github.com/mitchellh/gox
4. Make sure you cloned git-lob into $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/sinbad/git-lob
